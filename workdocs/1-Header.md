## Decaf-ts CLI

A modular command-line interface framework for Decaf-ts that dynamically discovers and loads CLI modules from different packages. The CLI provides a unified entry point (`decaf`) for executing commands from various Decaf modules, making it easy to extend with new functionality without modifying the core CLI code.
